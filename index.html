                            <p class="mb-0"><br>We’re going to talk about one of the most important ways we use the internet: To communicate! You would think the private communications between you, family, friends, and co-workers would be secure and private. Well, no. Unfortunately, we communicate on an internet where our messages are inherently insecure with the illusion that what’s being shared is kept private.<br><br></p>
                        </blockquote>
                    </figure>
                    <p><br>By default, it is extremely difficult to communicate privately and securely digitally. It’s a weird thing to think about. In our society, we respect people’s personal space because we want them to respect ours. If you want a conversation to be kept secret between you and another person, you simply talk in a room where no one else is listening. So how do you communicate safely over the internet?<br><br></p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Extra Information</h2>
                    <p><br>Well Signal, Threema, Wire, Telegram, and Wickr seem decent. Each has its pros and cons, so I’d recommend sorting through them yourself. Be wary of services like Whatsapp who collect metadata. Telegram is popular as well, although often debated in the security realm. They suffered a hack in 2016 that exposed 15 million phone numbers, and they use proprietary software on the backend so we can’t verify that.<br><br>No matter what service you end up going with, here are some things to research when selecting a messenger: Try to choose something with off-the-record messaging, or OTR--it’s a higher standard of encryption for messages. Also look for ‘Perfect Forward Secrecy” or PFS, so if one encryption key is compromised, the others will be safe. Lastly, don’t forget what information is required to open an account. Signal requires a phone number; you can fake this easily, but this still concerns people.<br><br></p><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange-multicolor.jpg" style="width: 5000px;">
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Email</h2>
                    <p><br>Moving on to email! This seems to be pretty good, right? Well, depending on your client, email can identify you by the IP address you use to send the message. Proxies do the trick well here, since the encryption is likely being handled by your email provider, and all we need is a tool to hide our IP address.<br><br></p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Concluding&nbsp;</h2>
                    <p><br>One final overlooked form of communication is file sharing. You can use email, but you’ll be limited on size and number of files. No matter how you share the file, make sure you encrypt it before uploading it to the internet. As for how to share it, if it’s encrypted it’s not a huge deal to upload on a service like Dropbox, but I’m still not going to recommend it. You can use something like Nextcloud. There’s also Firefox Send, which will encrypt and store a file. The last service is OnionShare, an open source project on Tor, which lets you securely and anonymously share a file of any size. This is very promising. No matter what service you choose, encrypt the file before uploading it, and give the password to your recipient using another communication method.<br><br></p><a href="#"></a>
